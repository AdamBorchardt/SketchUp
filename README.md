## README - SketchUp

This project contains code, markdown (md) documents, and text files.  The documentation
is best viewed at RubyDoc.info (linked to above).

### Project Folders

At present, all the code and docs are for documenting the constants defined in
the SketchUp Ruby API.

| Folder       | Contents                                                       |
|:-------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|
| docs         | All of the markdown files generated by code                    |
| su_info_txt  | All of tab delimited txt files generated by (and used by) code |
| lib/su_info  | All of the Ruby code and md templates                          |

### Documentation Files

The documents are generated by Ruby code that runs in SketchUp, and are version
specific.  Four documents are generated for each version (?? is two digit version,
v8 is 08, v2014 is 14). The two md files are in docs, the two txt files are in
su_info_txt.

All md and txt files are machine generated except the send_action.txt file, which
I scraped from SketchUp.com.

The md files are converted to html at RubyDoc.info, or one can use yard to do so.
The text files can be used for code generation or loaded in Excel, etc.

| File                                       | Desciption                                                                                |
|:-------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SketchUp_??\_Constants_Guide.md<br/>&#160; | Markdown file that includes notes, code, and links to<br/>SketchUp.com docs. |
| SketchUp_??\_Constants_List.md<br/>&#160;  | Markdown file that simply lists all the constants.  Also<br/>included is some information about the SketchUp objects. |
| su??\_constants_tab.txt<br/>&#160;         | Text file with tab delimited info.  Constants are grouped<br/>by namespace, but the namespace is not part of the string. |
| su??\_constants_tab_md.txt<br/>&#160;      | Text file with tab delimited info.  Constants are listed with<br/>full namespace. | 

### Notes

Both the 'Constants Guide' and the 'Constants List' are generated from templates.
Code adds all of the constant tables and some of the code snippets.  Hence, if two
versions of SketchUp have the same defined constants, there will be no difference
in the docs.  The templates appear in the RubyDoc file list as 'Guide_Title' and
'List_Title'.

All of the .rb files are at least partially documented.

### Generating Files

If one downloads and (unzips) the zip file from GitHub.com, simply load lib/su_info/create_su_constants.rb
from the console in SketchUp.  It takes some seconds, as it loops thru rendering
options for some data.  It shows a UI.messagebox when finished.  Two important items:
* All plugins / extensions need to be unloaded before running
* Have a new model open, as the code changes all RenderingOptions

@TODO Info on some of the RenderingOptions that are Fixnum enumerations

@TODO Code framework for use with WebDialogs & observers
